## Note that the options that require a file name, must not contain absolute
## paths. They are relative to the specified --homedir, which defaults to 
## ~/.pyzor

## All of these options are overridable from the respective command-line 
## arguments.

## The client section only affects the pyzor client.

[client]
## The `ServersFile` must contain a newline-separated list of server 
## addresses to report/whitelist/check with.
# ServersFile = servers

## The `AccountsFile` file containing information about accounts on servers. 
# AccountsFile = accounts

## This option specifies the name of the log file.
# LogFile = 

## The `LocaWhitelist` file containing skipped digests. 
# LocalWhitelist = whitelist

## This options specifies the number of seconds that the pyzor client should
## wait for a response from the server before timing out.
# Timeout = 5

## This options specifies the input style of the pyzor client. Current options
## are:
##  - msg (individual RFC5321 message) 
##  - mbox (mbox file of messages)  
##  - digests (Pyzor digests, one per line)
# Style = msg

## Thes options specify the threshold for number of reports/whitelists. 
## According to these thresholds the pyzor client exit code will differ.
# ReportThreshold = 0
# WhitelistThreshold = 0

## The server section only affects the pyzord server.

[server]
## Specifes the port and interface to listen on.
Port = 24441
ListenAddress = 0.0.0.0

## This option specifies the name of the log file.
LogFile = /data/logs/log.log
## This option specifies the name of the usage log file.
UsageLogFile = /data/logs/usage.log

## This file will contain the PID of the pyzord daemon, when the it's 
## started with the --detach options. The file is removed when the daemon is 
## closed
# PidFile = pyzord.pid

## This file must contain the username and their keys 
# PasswdFile = pyzord.passwd

## This file defines the ACL for the users
# AccessFile = pyzord.access

## If set to True then use the gevent library.
# Gevent = False

## These settings define the storage engine that the pyzord server should use.

## Example for gdbm (default):
# Engine = gdbm
# DigestDB   = pyzord.db

## Example for mysql:
# Engine = mysql
# DigestDB   = localhost,user,passwd,pyzor_db,pyzor_table

## Example for redis:
Engine = redis
# DigestDB = localhost,6379,,0
DigestDB = REDIS_SERVER,6379,,0
## Or if a password is required
# DigestDB = localhost,6379,passwd,0 

## The maximum age of an record, after which it will be removed.
## To disable this set this to 0.
# CleanupAge = 10368000 # aprox 4 months
CleanupAge = 10368000

## These setting define how and if the pyzord server should use concurrency
## For pre-forking
# PreFork = 0 # disabled
PreFork = 4

## For multi-threading:
# Threads = False
# MaxThreads = 0 # unlimited
# DBConnections = 0 # new connection for each request
Threads = True
MaxThreads = 4

## For multi-processing:
# Processes = False
# MaxProcesses = 40
